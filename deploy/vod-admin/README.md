# VOD Admin Implementation

This directory contains the VOD (Video on Demand) implementation fixes for the LiveKit admin panel.

## Key Fixes Applied

1. **Fixed LiveKit Room Creation for VOD Mode**
   - VOD videos no longer create unnecessary LiveKit rooms
   - Room creation is now only triggered for live broadcast mode

2. **Fixed Video Model file_path Method**
   - Made the `file_path` method public to fix 500 errors on VOD stream endpoints
   - This allows proper file access for VOD streaming

## Implementation Details

The VOD system now properly:
- Handles video uploads without creating LiveKit rooms
- Streams video files directly using HTML5 video elements
- Manages viewing sessions and analytics
- Supports JWT token authentication for secure access

## Configuration

The system uses:
- Redis for caching and Sidekiq job processing
- PostgreSQL for data storage
- LiveKit server for live broadcasting (when needed)

## Testing

Run the VOD smoke test:
```bash
./test_vod_smoke.sh
```

This will verify:
- Video upload functionality
- VOD streaming without LiveKit rooms
- Token generation and validation
- File storage and retrieval
